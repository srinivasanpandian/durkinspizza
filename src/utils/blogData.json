Spicy buffalo sauce, sliced marinated chicken, cheddar, and mozzarella make this selection a fan favorite. The last specialty pizza offered at the Durkin's is the Kitchen Sink, which by its name one would guess that this pizza has a lot of toppings, and that guess would be correct. Pepperoni, hamburger, Italian sausage, green peppers, red onions, and black olives are what make this pizza unique.

This classic is a go-to for many of our customers and we must say, it doesn't disappoint. This sandwich is made to order and always full of a lot of flavor. Last but not least of our lunch specials in McKinney is a small cheese pizza. For just $5.99 this is a steal! Our small pizza is the perfect portion size for a lunch meal, but you could always save a slice or two for a midnight snack later.

Feel free to add even more veggies if that's your heart's desire. The Buffalo Chicken Pizza is another fan favorite.

Choose any toppings you'd like: maybe pepperoni, fresh white onions, mushrooms and jalapeños? Or maybe you choose a completely different mix of toppings. Either way, it's going to taste super good and get to you super fast! If the picky eater in the family wants to opt out of pizza, we've got a Calzone that will knock your boots off. You can add any toppings you would like to much like a pizza, just enclosed and cooked to a golden crisp!",

        "blog-detail-description": "Pizza just might be one of the most versatile ways to grab a quick bite to eat. You can order pizza via takeout, delivery, dine-in, or even take-and-bake. For many of us, pizza was love at first bite. There's no debate as to whether or not pizza is a beautiful thing. In fact, I've yet to encounter anyone that doesn't love the ooey, gooey deliciousness we call pizza. According to research by Technomic, four in 10 Americans say they eat pizza at least once a week. And over 83% of us eat pizza at least once a month. I know that pizza has been my favorite food for awhile now, but what makes us love pizza near McKinney oh so much?",
